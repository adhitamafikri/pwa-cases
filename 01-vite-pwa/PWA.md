# PWA

## Tools

This PWA is built with [https://vite-pwa-org.netlify.app/](https://vite-pwa-org.netlify.app/) plugin

## Generating PWA Assets

- Create an `svg` logo and put it into the `public` directory
- Run the asset generation script -> `npm run generate-pwa-assets`. You might adjust the `svg` logo name based on the `svg` logo that you've put into `public` directory
